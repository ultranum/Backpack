# Backpack

Mini Multi Day

## Abstraction 
A container such as a backpack has many qualities, such as size, volume, color, brand, etc. but the program only requires the contents of the backpack and its name. 
## Aggregation
All of the items that are put inside the containers are an example of Aggregation.
## Encapsulation
The getter and setter methods in the holding class (getItems, getName) are examples of encapsulation, along with the str and repr magic methods for the items,
## Polymorphism
All the items each have a "Name"(Subject or Color). Though they all are an item (such as a pen), all the pens have different colors.
